# Hi there 👋🏾

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** from [Thiès, Senegal](https://goo.gl/maps/BGygcDETwaQU67aBA) 🇸🇳.

- 🗂 I currently work as a Frontend Software Engineer.
- 😀 I'm interested in **frontend engineering**, **design systems**, **JAMSTACK** & **serverless programming**, **javascript build tools** and **product design** in general.
- 👨🏾‍💻 I mostly speak in `.(js|ts)x`, `.css`, `.html`, `.php`, `.svg`, `.graphql`, `.yml` (😅) and also `.sketch` and `.fig`.
- 🙌🏽 Would love to get more involved in open source work, feel free to ping me about **testing**, **architecture**, **design**, **docs**, **triaging and maintaining issues**.
- 👀 Have an eye on learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/).
- I love sports 🏀⇢ ⚽️⇢ 🏐⇢ 🏃🏾‍♂️ and video games 🎮.
- 🌍 Anywhere in Africa is home to me.
